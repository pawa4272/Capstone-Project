Improving Instacart 1 customer at a time

Instacart was launched in June 2012 as a grocery delivery and pick-up service
It is essentially a delivery platform that partners with retailers across the United States and Canada to provide food products to their customers
By 2017 the retailer Whole Foods was responsible for more than 10 % of there sales
Their competitor Amazon acquired Whole Foods, for $13.7 billion in August 2017 … putting them now in second to Amazon  (Tom’s Guide)
For the past three years Instacart was able to maintain and retain their market share; based on 2019 figures, membership has tripled in 2020 

How can Instacart’s customers decrease the time spent by to complete their full order, improve their online experience and have them return as customers post Covid19? 

Problem Statement 
We need to predict what a customer may purchase on their next order (therefore directing them to the retailer that will fulfill their shopping needs)
